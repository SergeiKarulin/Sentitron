# Sentitron Research Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to the Sentitron Research Repository. This project represents a significant stride in the exploration of artificial neural network technologies. Our focus lies in developing and testing alternative approaches to neural network design and learning mechanisms, with an aim to address the limitations of current back-propagation methods, especially in terms of GPU resource and time efficiency.

## Research Objectives
Our objectives revolve around several key areas of innovation in neural network technology:

### Time-Driven Dynamics
- **Continuous Operation**: Unlike traditional neural networks, Sentitron is based on continuous, time-driven activity, orchestrated by an internal heartbeat mechanism.

### Autonomous Neuronal Activity
- **Independent Neuronal Discharge**: Exploring the behavior of neurons that autonomously discharge at regular intervals, differing from the stimulus-response mechanism in conventional models.

### Innovative Memory Formation
- **Memory Mechanisms**: Investigating new methods for memory formation in neural networks, focusing on how different stimulation patterns can lead to short-term and long-term memory development.

### Feedback Loop Dynamics
- **Internal Feedback Loops**: Utilizing the network's output as its own input to study the effects and potential of internal feedback mechanisms in AI systems.

### Synaptic Variability and Neuronal Fatigue
- **Dynamic Network Behavior**: Examining the influence of varying synaptic deactivation rates and the concept of neuronal fatigue on the overall behavior of neural networks.

### Learning Process Without Back-Propagation
- **Alternative Learning Methods**: Developing learning processes that move away from traditional back-propagation, potentially leading to more efficient neural network training.

## Applications
Sentitron is a valuable platform for researchers, AI enthusiasts, and anyone interested in alternative approaches to AI. It serves as a testbed for new ideas in neural network architectures and learning methods, contributing to more efficient and effective AI solutions.

## Contribution
We encourage collaboration and contributions from the AI community. Whether you're a researcher, a student, or just an AI enthusiast, your insights and experiments can help shape the future of neural network technologies.
