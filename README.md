# Sentitron

Welcome to the Sentitron repository, an illustration of the concept for artificial neural network model designed to emulate aspects of continuous consciousness in a digital environment. Sentitron stands apart from traditional neural networks by its unique operation and learning mechanisms.

Key Features:
Time-Driven Dynamics: Sentitron operates continuously, driven by an internal heartbeat mechanism, ensuring constant signal processing.
Autonomous Neuronal Activity: Neurons in Sentitron discharge at regular intervals, with input signals only modulating the rate of discharge.
Memory Formation: Short-term memory emerges from random stimulation loops, while long-term memory develops from loops that persist over time.
Feedback Loop: The network's output is fed back into its input, facilitating complex internal dynamics.
Synaptic Uniqueness: Each synapse deactivates at its own rate, adding to the network's dynamic variability.
Adaptive Attention: Sentitron can shift its focus between external inputs and internal signals, emulating a form of digital attention.
Neuronal Fatigue: To prevent overstimulation, neurons experience fatigue, raising their activation thresholds temporarily.
Learning Process:
Sentitron's learning does not rely on back-propagation. Instead, it learns through interactions with both external stimuli and its own internal signal generation, offering a fresh perspective on AI learning mechanisms.

Applications:
This model is tailored to help researchers and enthusiasts interested in exploring new forms of artificial intelligence, particularly those that step away from traditional, input-output driven neural networks. Whether it's for academic research, AI experimentation, or just for the curious, Sentitron offers a unique platform to delve into the world of continuous, time-driven neural networks."
